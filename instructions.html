          Minado is an implementation of the classic minesweeper game. Mines are
          laid randomly on the field, and you must open all cells without
          opening a cell with a mine.
        </p>

        <p>
          Start playing by left-clicking on any cell, which is guaranteed to not
          contain a mine.
        </p>

        <p>
          On every opened and mine-free cell there will be a number from 1 to 8,
          telling you the amount of mines adjacent to that cell. If there are
          zero mines adjacent to that cell, no number is displayed.
        </p>

        <p>If you think a cell contains a mine, flag it by right-clicking.</p>

        <p>
          Continue opening cells and flagging possible mines. When you’ve opened
          every non-mine cell, the board is complete and you win. If you open a
          cell with a mine, you lose.
        </p>

        <p>
          Customise your game with the “Customise game” button. You may change
          the field’s amount of rows and columns, and the amount of mines. The
          larger the field and the more mines, the harder the game.
